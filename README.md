# Awesome Robotics and Intelligent Agent Companies [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A List of Companies, Both Large and Small, That Are Stable and Developing Robots or Autonomous Intelligent Agents  

Robotics is awesome, and people who think robotics is awesome are awesome, so I have a decided to put together a living list of important industry innovators in robotics and artificially intelligent agents. This is updated somewhat infrequently but is mostly accurate, and intended to be a starting point for people who want to developing careers in this space. If you want your/some other company added to this list, or think something needs to be adjusted, please a pull request (obviously adhering to the contributing guidelines)!

NOTE: A lot of companies are saying that they have "AI" at this point. The companies on this list are restricted to what could be called "AI agency", that is, specifically, using artificial intelligence to enable autonomous agents that make their own decisions. This is not to be confused with the umbrella term "AI" being used today which includes generic machine learning, data analysis, and data visionalization, as these are all areas that enable _human_ decision makers. Occasionally I will throw in a computer vision focused company because of the degree to which the technology transfers.

_All locations listed are primary locations for engineering development, so the locations lists will be representative but are not guaranteed to be complete._

## Stable Start-ups
This list contains what I am calling start-ups, which is any company that isn't public, has a valuation at <$500M, has only a single primary location, and/or does not have a revenue stream that could result in stable profitability. "Stable" doesn't mean they cannot fail, but this list will not be used to keep track of every single effort as that would be exhuasting. If you want something like that, may I suggest [CrunchBase](www.crunchbase.com) and [Robotics Business Review](https://www.roboticsbusinessreview.com/).
